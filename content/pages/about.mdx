# Me
Ola, my name is Tiago and I am a dad, a strategist working in the innovation space and a 
developer apprentice. A couple of years back I moved to Singapore with my better half and our 
2 kids have been born in the little red dot.

I have started this website as a small experiment to teach myself how to code, to share that 
journey and to put "pen to paper" on stuff that I like to do and to think about.

Hope you enjoy! 


# Us
Briefly describing me wouldn't be complete without uploading a picture of the four of us ðŸ˜Ž! 
For some reason I couldn't find a nice picture with the four of us together, go figure!
