# Me
Ola, my name is Tiago and I am a dad, a husban , a strategist working in the innovation space and a 
developer apprentice. A couple of years back I moved to Singapore with my better half and our 
2 kids have been born in the little red dot.

I have started this website as a small experiment to teach myself how to code, to share that 
journey and to put "pen to paper" on stuff that I like to do and to think about.

Hope you enjoy! 


# Us
Briefly describing me wouldn't be complete without sharing a picture of my family ðŸ˜Ž! 
For some reason I couldn't find a nice picture with the four of us together, go figure!

# Tech that I use 

This little corner on the internet (a.k.a my digital garden) was built with [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), 
and I am using [airtable](https://airtable.com/) and [convertKit](https://convertkit.com/) to manage emails, 
some of the pictures are being hosted in [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), the blog posts and pages are 
written in markdown and MDX. 

In short a genuine [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) digital asset ðŸ¤£.
